<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What went well / what was helpful?” “What was that relationship like? How did it help you? What is one helpful thing your mentor/mentee said/did?</p>
<p>What didn’t work? What you needed, and your mentor/mentee couldn’t help you? or didn’t understand you?</p>

<p>Give them one-two minutes to write in silence. Then you can read some of the answers aloud or add some comments on the doc in silence. Encourage them to read their classmate’s answers and do comments.</p>

<section id="mentors-roles.-mentorship-skills" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mentors-roles.-mentorship-skills">Mentors roles. Mentorship skills</h3>
<p>You continue with <strong>slide three</strong> about the mentors’ roles.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What do mentors do? Mentors advise and inspire. How do you do this?. Recommend resources, readings, training, experiences. Feedback to consider. Connect to people, programs, and organizations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You should give examples of each activity related to the type of project they will be mentoring. On <strong>slide four</strong>, you summarise the mentorship skills we will see today:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Active Listening, Effective Questioning, Giving Feedback.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Show <strong>slide five</strong> now about active listening. Before showing some bullets point, you start with a question:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Please, answer on the chat or unmute yourself and answer: What is active listening? How active listening looks like?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Give them time to think and share. Read aloud the chat if someone shares in writing form. Iterate on what they said. They will be able to mention helpful information you can note when you show the bullet point about active listening. For example, someone can share that active listening is <em>when people ask good and insightful questions. Or when they pay attention to you (they aren’t watching their phone or answering their email)</em>.</p>
<p>Now follows with <strong>slide six</strong> about effective questioning. Before showing effective questioning concepts and tips, make the questions:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Why questions are important in mentoring? What kind of questions are helpful?. Please, answer on the chat or unmute yourself and answer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Give them time to think and share. Read aloud the chat if someone shares in writing form. Give priority to the people that don’t participate in the previous question. Iterate on what they said. Use their answer when sharing the bullets point on the slide.</p>
<p>As the final part of this section, you go to <strong>slide seven</strong> about giving feedback. Here we have two prompt questions:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What happens if you only give positive feedback? As we did previously, please share your thoughts in the chat or by speaking up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After two or three of them share their thoughts, you can ask the second question:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What happens if we provide only negative feedback?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Give them time to think and share. Read aloud the chat if someone shares in writing form.</p>
<p>Now show the cartoon about feedback and the bullets point on the slide. One more time use their answer to give examples or support this points. Mention that:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Feedback can be the way you provide advice. It also allows everyone to grow.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The source material for good feedback is built on the above two skills, active listening and effective questioning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following slide (number eight) present Meetings.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Meetings are one of the places where mentoring will happen and where mentors will use the skill we mention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note we create templates for meeting as scaffolding for their mentorship task. And then introduce the GROW model.</p>
</section>
<section id="mentor-tools.-grow-model." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mentor-tools.-grow-model.">Mentor tools. GROW Model.</h3>
<p>Use slides nine and ten to introduce the model and then you do the second exercise.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>You will work in groups for the next exercise. You will have 10 minutes to watch the video linked in the shared doc. It is an example using the GROW model. The idea is you try to identify the steps of the model. You can re-watch the video or stop, answer, and then continue. Please use the shared doc on your group space to write your questions._</p>
<p>When you finish, we will discuss your answer with the whole group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can create random groups, with no more than 3-4 people in each group. Read their answer during the exercise and choose some groups to share with the whole class. Choose each group because they add something interesting or different to the discussion. If you have a few groups, give all of them a chance to share their insight.</p>

<section id="mentor-tools.-program-logistics" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mentor-tools.-program-logistics">Mentor tools. Program logistics</h3>
<p>The next session introduces the Mentors Guidelines and others infrastructure and tools we developed for the champions program.</p>
<p>Shared slide <strong>thirteen</strong>, mention each tool, and then show the tools. The most important one is the <em>Mentors Guidelines</em>. You can click on the slides to open the document and go through it, showing each section, the list of resources, and the information we gather there for them.</p>
<p>You can click on the link to the other resources inside the guidelines to show them: be sure to show the google drive and the meeting templates. Finally, you can ask if they want to check the Slack channels.</p>

Checking for Access
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>This is an excellent time to check for access to these resources: are all in Slack and the proper channels? Do you have access to google drive and google docs? Can you copy the meeting templates and access the meeting report form?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now it is time for the next exercise. With the prompt “Are you ready for mentoring?” we provide space for comments, questions, and clarifications mentors need. Allow them to speak or write on the shared document or the chat. If they ask on the chat, copy those comments on the shared doc. These questions can be useful for the other cohorts. The time for this activity is 10 minutes, but take more minutes if they have good questions about the mentoring role or the program. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The final exercise calls mentors to practice giving constructive feedback by filling out an anonymous feedback survey about the training. Share the link to the form on the chat or mention they can access the link on the shared note. Give 5 minutes to fill out the survey.</p>
<div class="callout-tip callout callout-style-default callout-captioned">

</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>For this final exercise, you can also ask students to write on the chat <em>“Done!”</em> or <em>“Finish!”</em> or similar when they finish. This way, you will know, and you can end the activity when all are done. Some times this can mean before the time allocated for the exercise.</p>

<section id="post-training" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="post-training">Post-training</h2>
<p>After the training send a message (email, Slack) thanking those who attended and re-sharing important resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shared document (which has links to the slides, mentoring guide, meeting templates, etc).</li>
<li>Recording of the meeting (in case you have recorded it)</li>
<li>The feedback survey (for a second change to fill)</li>
</ul>
<p>Check the feedback survey and identify one or two point to improve for the nex iteraction of the training.</p>
